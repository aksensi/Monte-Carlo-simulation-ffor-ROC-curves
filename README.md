  -  Considering two hypothesis H_o : r = n and H_1 : r = m + N, where n is a normal distribution ~N(0, sig^2), m is a normal random variable, and r is the recieved signal. Performing a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 trails in order to generate the ROC curve for Probability of Detection(P_D) over Probability of False Alarm(P_F). Consider three defelection ratio cases, d=m/sig = 0.5, 1, 2.
  
##Introduction
Monte Carlo simulation is a computational method used to estimate the probability of different outcomes in a process that has uncertainty. It involves generating random values and using them to simulate a process or system. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis is a tool used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.

## About
This repository contains code and examples and a report related to Monte Carlo simulation and ROC curve using MATLAB.

Monte Carlo Simulation
The MonteCarlo_DetectionEstimation.m file contains a MonteCarloSimulation that can be used to perform Monte Carlo simulations. The code is easy written an dcommented for understanding.
