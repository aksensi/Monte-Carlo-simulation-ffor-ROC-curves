## Repository Type: Academic Project

# Project Description
NCSU ECE 751 - Detection, Estimation and Filtering Theory
- Instructor: Prof. G. Bottomley

  -  Considering two hypothesis H_o : r = n and H_1 : r = m + N, where n is a normal distribution ~N(0, sig^2), m is a normal random variable, and r is the recieved signal. Performing a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 trails in order to generate the ROC curve for Probability of Detection(P_D) over Probability of False Alarm(P_F). Consider three defelection ratio cases, d=m/sig = 0.5, 1, 2.
  

  
## About
- kalman_run has the code file which has comments for reference. The inputs of the filter is taken by example 9.10 from the textbook, Detection, Estimation and Modulation Theory -  Van Trees.
- The document that starts with ECE751 has the output of the filter and is a detailed explaination of the project.
